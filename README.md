## Prerequisites

- Bash 4.0 or higher (`brew install bash` on mac).
- curl 
- git

## Installation

### Installing using the setup script

This setup script will download the sgit executable to /usr/local/bin/ and install an autocomplete script in the bash completions directory.

```bash
$ bash <(curl -Ls raw.githubusercontent.com/mkuchak/sugar-git/main/setup)
```

### Installing manually

Download the [sgit](sgit) script to `/usr/local/bin/` or anywhere in your `PATH`, and make it executable.

If you wish to have all package name auto-completed for all `sgit` commands, add this line to your startup script (for example: `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`):

```bash
complete -W '$(sgit list -s)' sgit
```

### Tips: edit your default git editor, automatic push tags... (optional)

```bash 
$ git config --global core.editor "code --wait" # nano, vim...
$ git config --global push.followTags true
$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
$ git config --global user.email "youremail@yourdomain.com"
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Start a new git repository
$ git init

# Create a new feature branch
$ sgit take -f "my awesome feature"

# Result:
# git checkout -b "feature/my-awesome-feature"

# Create new file
$ echo "Hello, world!" > README.MD

# Initial commit
$ sgit feat "initial commit" -Ap

# Result:
# git add --all
# git commit -m "feat: initial commit"
# git push origin feature/my-awesome-feature

# Start Node.js project
$ npm init -y
$ echo "console.log('Hello, world! ðŸŒŽ')" > index.js

# Commit feat changes
$ sgit feat -s core "add welcome message" -a index.js

# Result:
# git add index.js
# git commit -m "feat(core): add welcome message"

# Commit build changes
$ sgit build "npm init" -Ap

# Result:
# git add --all
# git commit -m "build: npm init"
# git push origin feature/my-awesome-feature

# Update same feature
$ echo "console.log('Hello, folks! ðŸ‘¯')" >> index.js

# Alter last commit with current changes and push to remote repository
$ sgit amend -Apf

# Result:
# git add --all
# git commit --amend --no-edit
# git push origin feature/my-awesome-feature --force

# Add an annotated tag
$ sgit tag v0.1.0

# Result:
# git tag -a v0.1.0 -m 0.1.0

# Push tag to remote repository (if you have configured `git config --global push.followTags true`)
$ sgit put

# Result:
# git push origin feature/my-awesome-feature
```
